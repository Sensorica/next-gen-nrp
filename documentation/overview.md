# Holochain Network Resource Planning 2.0 Overview

## Introduction

Holochain Network Resource Planning 2.0 (NRP2) is a distributed, peer-to-peer contribution logging system built using Holochain. It represents the evolution of Sensorica's original Network Resource Planning system into a full-featured implementation based on modern distributed economic principles.

## Historical Context

The [original NRP system](https://github.com/Sensorica/VerdunNRP) was developed by Sensorica in collaboration with Lynn Foster and Bob Haugen, who later created the ValueFlow specification and hREA framework. This prototype implementation pioneered many concepts in value network coordination and resource planning that are now standard in distributed economic networks.

## Open Value Network Implementation

NRP2 is specifically designed to support Open Value Networks (OVN), providing:

- Transparent value creation and distribution
- Peer-to-peer governance mechanisms
- Commons-based peer production tools
- Fair reward distribution systems
- Network-level resource coordination

## Implementation Roadmap

The current implementation structure is temporary and serves as a foundation for future development. The system will be reimplemented using:

- **ValueFlow Specification**: A vocabulary for distributed economic networks, which will provide standardized patterns for resource and value flows
- **hREA Framework**: Holochain Resource Event Architecture, implementing REA (Resources, Events, Agents) accounting patterns for distributed economic networks
- **Original NRP Toolset**: Incorporating the proven tools and methodologies from the original NRP system

This transition will ensure better interoperability with other ValueFlow-compatible systems and provide a more robust foundation for economic resource tracking.
