# Holochain Network Resource Planning 2.0 Overview

## Introduction
Holochain Network Resource Planning 2.0 (NRP2) is a distributed, peer-to-peer contribution logging system built using Holochain. It enables users to track and verify contributions across various projects in a decentralized manner.

## Implementation Roadmap
The current implementation structure is temporary and serves as a foundation for future development. The system will be reimplemented using:

- **ValueFlow Specification**: A vocabulary for the distributed economic networks, which will provide standardized patterns for resource and value flows
- **hREA Framework**: Holochain Resource Event Architecture, implementing REA (Resources, Events, Agents) accounting patterns for distributed economic networks

This transition will ensure better interoperability with other ValueFlow-compatible systems and provide a more robust foundation for economic resource tracking.

## Key Features
- Decentralized contribution tracking
- Peer-to-peer data synchronization
- Resource management and planning
- Process tracking and verification
- Context-aware contribution logging
